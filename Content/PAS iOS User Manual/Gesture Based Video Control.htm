        <h1>Gesture Based Video Control</h1>
        <p>When using the InTouch Provider Access Software, the Patient Access Device cameras’ pan, tilt, and zoom features are controlled by a series of gestures. In many cases you are controlling the head motion of the Patient Access Device, not just the camera. </p>
        <div class="Note">
            <p><b class="Note">NOTES</b>: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be Patient! Remember that gesture commands are traveling over an Internet connection to the Patient Access Device, then causing a head or camera motion, and finally the video returns over an Internet connection to be displayed on the InTouch Provider Access Software. Bandwidth limitations and interruptions may cause significantly delay (seconds) in viewing the results of your commands.</li>
                <li>If using an iPad, tap the Quick Help button in the Info Menu for the Gesture help screen overlay.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Spread (Zoom In)</h3>
        <p>Gently press with two fingers and spread them apart until you zoom in to the desired level. The zoomed video will take a second to appear after you remove your fingers from the display. Remember that both fingers must remain in contact within the Remote Display view (either full screen or normal).</p>
        <h3>Pinch (Zoom Out)</h3>
        <p>Gently press with two fingers and pinch them together until you zoom out to the desired level. The zoomed video will take a second to appear after you remove your fingers from the display. Remember that both fingers must remain in contact within the Remote Display view (either full screen or normal).</p>
        <h3>Box-Zoom (Zoom In)</h3>
        <p>Gently press and drag with a single finger to make a zoom box. Start with your finger in the center of the view you would like to see close up, then drag until the zoom box includes all that you want to see. The box-zoom outline will follow as you move your finger, and when released the zoomed video will take a second to appear.</p>
        <h3>Tap (Point-to-See)</h3>
        <p>Gently press and release with a single finger. Use a tap to select a button in a tool bar or dialog box. When you tap in the live Remote Camera view (Point-to-See), the Patient Access Device will center and focus on that point in the Remote Camera view. When in session on an InTouch Xpress, or other Patient Access Device without head motion, the camera view will not re-center if the zoom setting is full screen. </p>
        <h3>Double-tap (Zoom Out)</h3>
        <p>Gently and quickly press and release twice with a single finger. When you double-tap in the live Remote Camera view, the Patient Access Device will return to full view from any zoom level while remaining focused on the same spot.</p>
        <h3>Triple-tap (Zoom Out and Center Head)</h3>
        <p>Gently and quickly press and release three times with a single finger. When you Triple-tap in the live Remote Camera view, the Patient Access Device will return to full view from any zoom level and return to its home head position. The home head position is typically level and facing straight forward.</p>
