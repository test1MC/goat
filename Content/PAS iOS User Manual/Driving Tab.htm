        <p>Gestures are used by the InTouch Provider Access Software to control drivable Patient Access Devices. Although Manual driving is accomplished using the same gesture-based commands for the InTouch 7, InTouch 7i, and InTouch Vita, they each have different sensor arrays that will affect the driving experience. The InTouch Vita has enhanced AutoDRIVE and Point-to-Drive video-based driving features. Refer to “<MadCap:xref href="InTouch Vita Point-to-Drive Video Based Driving.htm" class="RelativeXref">Vita Point-to-Drive Video Based Driving on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>” and “<MadCap:xref href="InTouch Vita Point-to-Drive Video Based Driving.htm#InTouch" class="RelativeXref">InTouch Vita AutoDRIVE on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>”.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Before driving, use a two-finger, triple-tap gesture to look down and backwards for a power plug or docking station.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="NoteWImage"><b class="Note">CAUTION</b>: For an Patient Access Device that is plugged into a wall outlet, driving away at an angle could prevent the plug from releasing properly resulting in damage.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Using a single-finger, triple-tap gesture to return the Patient Access Device to fully zoom out and return to its home head position facing straight forward.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Note"><b class="Note">NOTE</b>: The Patient Access Device head will automatically look in the forward direction when driving in the forward direction. If driving backwards, the Patient Access Device will look backwards and down whenever the Joystick is commanding over 50% of maximum speed.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>To drive using an iPad, tap the Driving icon on the iPad Tab Bar. The drive using an iPhone, tap the Driving button&#160; in the iPhone Tool Bar. Tap the Driving button again to close the Virtual Joystick. <ul MadCap:continue="true"><li>The Virtual Joystick and the Left and Right Slide buttons are shown in the Tab Display screen area of the iPad, and at the bottom of the iPhone screen. Settings for the Virtual Joystick can be found in the Settings Menu on the Tool Bar (See “<MadCap:xref href="iOS Tab Bar.htm" class="RelativeXref">iOS Tab Bar on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>”).</li></ul><ul MadCap:continue="true"><li>Press and drag the Joystick forward or back to drive the Patient Access Device forward or back. The further you push the Joystick, the faster the Patient Access Device goes.</li><li>Press and drag the Joystick to either side to rotate the Patient Access Device in that direction.</li><li>Press the left or right slide buttons to slide the Patient Access Device in that direction.</li></ul><ul MadCap:continue="true"><li>All of these actions can take place at the same time. When you are no longer touching a control, the Patient Access Device stops.</li></ul></li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Collision Avoidance Override /Nudge Mode (iPad Only)</h3>
        <p>Nudge mode allows the collision avoidance feature to be overridden to drive in very tight spaces or to nudge an obstacle. The speed of the Patient Access Device is limited when driving in Nudge mode. Patient Access Devices are designed to allow you to push an obstacle or open a door by pushing with their bumpers. When the Nudge button is no longer pressed, the collision avoidance sensors are reactivated.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="NoteWImage" style="margin-left: 0;margin-right: 3in;"><b class="Note">CAUTION</b>: When using Nudge mode, ensure that contact with the Patient Access Device is only at the bumpers on the base of the robot. The Patient Access Device can be damaged if pushed into an obstacle against any part other than the bumpers.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>As shown at the bottom right, the driver is pushing the joystick forward and to the left to make a small left turn while going forward into the room.</li>
            <li>When approaching a doorway or hallway, stop and use a two-finger, double-tap to look both ways.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Patient Access Device Head will swivel to the left, to the right, and then back to forward allowing you to see both ways.</p>

        <div class="Note">
            <p><b class="Note">NOTES</b>: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If an InTouch 7 or InTouch 7i is unplugged and the battery level drops too low, a voice message can be heard saying, “Please plug me in.” </li>
                <li> If the InTouch Vita is unplugged, not in a remote session, and the battery level drops too low, it will AutoDRIVE to its docking/charging station and plug itself in. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="Note">
            <p><b class="Note">WARNINGS</b>: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The InTouch 7, InTouch 7i, and InTouch Vita each stands approximately 5.5 ft. tall (168 cm) and weighs over 180 lb. (82 kg). An untrained operator could potentially bring about a collision, possibly causing damage or injury. The driver is responsible for safe operation while driving manually—please drive carefully. </li>
                <li>Patient Access Devices are not MRI safe nor MRI compatible and should only be used in locations where the presence of metal is not controlled. </li>
                <li>Always look in the direction the Patient Access Device is traveling. </li>
                <li>The InTouch 7 and InTouch 7i are not designed to safely traverse ramps. Do not drive them up or down ramps. </li>
                <li>Do not attempt to drive up or down stairs!</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="Note"><b class="Note">CAUTION</b>: If video equipment or other external devices are connected to an InTouch Vita, request that the E-Stop button be pushed in to prohibit AutoDRIVE. The equipment and/or the InTouch Vita may be damaged if, for example, the InTouch Vita attempts to return to its docking station after a session because of a low battery.</p>
