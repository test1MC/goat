        <p>The stethoscope, installed on the InTouch Vita and some other InTouch devices, allows remote auscultation from the InTouch Provider Access Software when combined with a headset such as the Sennheiser PX-200-IIi. InTouch Health recommends using only high quality headsets; request the publication&#160; for a list of validated headsets.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Stethoscope Operation</h2>
        <p>When logged in to an Patient Access Device with a built-in stethoscope, the stethoscope button  on the Toolbar will be enabled.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Attach your headset to the iPad / iPhone and put your headset on.</li>
            <li>Tap the stethoscope button to enable the controls.</li>
            <li>Tap the Start button to start the stethoscope.<ul><li>Adjust the volume using the iPad / iPhone volume buttons as needed, keeping the volume level to the lowest gain necessary to avoid sound distortions.</li><li>When using the stethoscope it is important that both the InTouch Provider Access Software user and the patient refrain from talking. Tap the Stop button if you need to communicate, then tap the Play button to start again.</li></ul></li>
        </ol>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Tap the <b class="ScreenItem">Stop </b>button when finished.</li>
            <li>Tap the stethoscope button to disable <br />the controls.<br /></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Note"><b class="Note">NOTE</b>: The Patient Access Device software priority is to guarantee that sound taken in from the stethoscope is reproduced with complete fidelity on the InTouch Provider Access Software side. To achieve this, a buffering scheme is used to guard against Internet delays. This means that the audio which is heard from the stethoscope is accurate, but lagging about one second behind.</p>
        <h2 style="page-break-before: always;">Stethoscope Technical Service</h2>
        <p>If a problem should arise in regard to use of the stethoscope on the Patient Access Device, please contact InTouch Health Technical Service, so that Technical Service can determine the source of the issue. Questions about the stethoscope controls can be answered by reference to the stethoscope manual.</p>
