        <h1>iOS Settings Menu</h1>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/iOS Settings Menu.png" class="floatright" style="width: 202px;height: 241px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Tapping the Settings icon (<img src="../Resources/Images/iPhone Settings Icon.png" style="width: 17px;height: 19px;" />) opens the Settings Menu. Tap on any menu option to open it. Tap elsewhere on the iPad / iPhone display to close the menu option.</p>
        <h2><a name="Picture"></a><a name="Picture_in_Picture"></a>Picture in Picture</h2>
        <p>Tapping on the Picture in Picture slider in the main Settings Menu allows you to toggle on and off the PIP box on your iPad screen (See “<MadCap:xref href="iPad Dashboard.htm" class="RelativeXref">iPad Dashboard on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>”). This is not to be confused with the Picture in Picture box on the Patient Access Device screen (See “<MadCap:xref href="#Remote" class="RelativeXref">Remote Controls on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>”).</p>
        <h2>Driving</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/iOS Driving Options.png" class="floatright" style="width: 221px;height: 201px;" />
        </p>
        <p>The Driving controls menu option allows you to change your driving settings for drivable Patient Access Devices.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Change your default driving speed by tapping on Slow, Medium, or Fast speed.</li>
            <li>Tap on the Joystick on the right slider to toggle your joystick location to the right or left on the screen.</li>
            <li>Tap on the Speed indicator slider to toggle the speed indicator on your InTouch Provider Access Software screen on and off (iPad only).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Remote"></a>Remote Controls</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/iOS Remote Controls Settings.png" class="floatright" style="width: 218px;height: 231px;" />
        </p>
        <p>The Remote Controls menu allows you to control settings on the Patient Access Device. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tap the Automatic Brightness slider to it on and off. This will change the brightness you see in the Remote Camera View. When Automatic Brightness is turned off, you have the option to manually change the brightness of the Remote Camera View using the slider directly below.</li>
            <li>Press and drag the Speaker Volume slider to change the volume that you are heard on the Patient Access Device speakers.</li>
            <li>Tap the Picture in Picture slider to toggle on and off the Picture in Picture box on the Patient Access Device screen. This is not to be confused with the Picture in Picture box on the iPad InTouch Provider Access Software screen (See “<MadCap:xref href="#Picture" class="RelativeXref">Picture in Picture on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>”)</li>
            <li>The Video Quality Preference (smooth motion versus sharp image) allows you to specify a preference for smoother motion or a sharper image. Prefer smooth motion is the default option and is always selected at the start of a session. Prefer sharp image will provide the highest possible video resolution within the available network bandwidth, but some choppiness may occur in scenes with motion, especially over low bandwidth connections.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Auto Logout</h2>
        <p>To protect against unauthorized access to Patient Access Device sessions or patient data, InTouch Health requires that all users utilize the Auto Logout feature. The default setting for the InTouch Provider Access Software is to automatically logout after 15 minutes of inactivity. The Auto Logout feature is disabled when in session with a Patient Access Device.</p>
