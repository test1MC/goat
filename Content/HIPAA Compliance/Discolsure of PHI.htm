        <h2>Disclosure of PHI</h2>
        <p>If the physician plans to transmit or copy stored images or video to other individuals or organ- izations, e.g., to a healthcare operator, the physician needs to abide by standard HIPAA codes governing who may receive PHI and under what conditions. The hospital’s HIPAA compliance officer should be consulted for details.</p>
