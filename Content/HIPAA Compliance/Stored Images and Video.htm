        <h2>Stored Images and Video</h2>
        <p>By default when saved, all captured images and video files are stored as encrypted files viewable only by the Provider Access Software user who captured them. All files whether encrypted or not should also be saved in the user’s InTouch Health Media Vault (folder) to provide added protection.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>For convenience these files may be saved in common formats, e.g., JPEG for still images. These files are no longer encrypted and therefore are viewable by any user who can access them. As such, there are a few recommended techniques for safeguarding PHI contained in these images and video:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure all personnel who have access to the Provider Access Software also have full permission to access stored images and videos under the hospital’s policies and procedures;</li>
            <li>Make sure to store captured images and videos only on removable media (e.g., recordable CD-ROMs) which can be taken with each user or on secure network drives;</li>
            <li>Do not save to disk any captured images and video clips. Use these images and video segments only while logged in for a particular session.</li>
        </ul>
