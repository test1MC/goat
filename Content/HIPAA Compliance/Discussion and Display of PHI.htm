        <h2>Discussion and Display of PHI</h2>
        <p>From time to time a physician will likely engage in remote communications with patients and medical staff in which patient information (records, images and video) will be discussed or displayed. In general, the same care should be exercised as though the physician were physically present. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use Head rotation to look around and see who else is nearby and might see or hear the sensitive information, and use appropriate discretion.</li>
            <li>Use the microphone mute button when conversing with someone alongside the InTouch Provider Access Software to avoid the inadvertent conferencing of patient-related conversation.</li>
            <li>The InTouch Provider Access Software screen should be positioned to point away from public areas, so as not to be visible to passersby.</li>
        </ul>
