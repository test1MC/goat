        <h2>Recommended Guidelines for HIPAA Compliance</h2>
        <p>The Remote Presence System allows hospitals and medical professionals to remain in compliance with HIPAA privacy regulations. InTouch Health is providing the following information to assist with HIPAA privacy regulations as they pertain to the Remote Presence System.</p>
        <p>HIPAA requires all healthcare organizations to have policies and procedures, and the guidelines below may not cover all situations as they apply to a specific organization. Further, from time to time automatic software upgrades may be downloaded which may contain new features. InTouch Health will inform users of significant features as they are added, and the impact of these features and how they may affect HIPAA policies, procedures and safeguards should be considered.</p>
