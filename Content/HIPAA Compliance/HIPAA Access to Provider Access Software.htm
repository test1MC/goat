        <h2>Access to Provider Access Software </h2>
        <p>The computer using the Provider Access Software should be placed in a location that is only accessible to individuals who have authorized access to Protected Health Information (PHI). It is recommended that Provider Access Software access is password protected via a Windows or iOS user account.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Only authorized users should have passwords, and users should safeguard passwords according to hospital policies and procedures. Passwords should be treated as highly confidential information. If you believe your password may have been compromised, it should be changed as soon as possible. Change your password by clicking on the "Forgot Password" link on the login screen of the InTouch Provider Access Software.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Auto Logout feature is set to log out of the InTouch Provider Access Software when the system is inactive for a period of time. Also, all users should be trained to log out of Windows, iOS or the Virtual Private Network (VPN), when away from the system for any period of time. This is important for security reasons, so that any person attempting access to the Provider Access Software will be required to enter a password for secure access.</p>
