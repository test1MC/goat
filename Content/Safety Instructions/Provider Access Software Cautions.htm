        <h2>Provider Access Software Cautions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid driving a Patient Access Device on wet carpets or flooring. It may be difficult to maintain control.</li>
            <li>The Patient Access Device is for indoor use only. Do not drive outside.</li>
            <li>To safely navigate tight spaces it may be necessary to reduce driving speed.</li>
            <li>When using Nudge mode, ensure that contact with the Patient Access Device is only at the bumpers on the base of the Patient Access Device. The Patient Access Device can be damaged if pushed into an obstacle against any part other than the bumpers.</li>
            <li>When experiencing long video/audio delays, InTouch Health recommends driving with caution at a reduced speed.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Videos taken through the Provider Access Software are encrypted by default and may only be replayed through the Provider Access Software. Attempting to play videos taken from the Provider Access Software Application outside of the software may require additional software. (Contact Technical Service for more information.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>For computers with the Stethoscope enhancement feature, a replacement headset must have a frequency response level down to 18 Hz for proper sound quality.</li>
        </ul>
