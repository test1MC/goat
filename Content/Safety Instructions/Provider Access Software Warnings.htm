        <h2>Provider Access Software Warnings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>InTouch Health requires all users to first be trained in the proper use of drivable Patient Access Devices. These Patient Access Devices stand approximately 5.5 ft. tall (168 cm) and weigh between 178 and 220 lb. (81 - 100 kg). An untrained operator could potentially bring about a collision, possibly causing damage or injury.</li>
            <li>The Patient Access Device is designed to utilize the 802.ll communication protocol as well as the public Internet in order to achieve its intended purpose. Failures in either of these supporting systems could cause a complete loss of communication between the Provider Access Software and the Patient Access Device. Consequently, the Patient Access Device should not be utilized in any activities where successful completion of the activity is dependent upon uninterrupted communication between the Patient Access Device and the Provider Access Software.</li>
            <li>A tested backup method of communication should be available in the event network communication is lost.</li>
            <li>Some Patient Access Devices utilizes a Class II Laser which complies with 21 CFR Chapter 1, subchapter j. Maximum Laser radiation output is less than one milliWatt. Refer to the appropriate Patient Access Device User Manual to determine the specific wavelength (color) employed by the laser pointer.</li>
            <li>Dazzle, flash-blindness, and afterimages may be caused by a beam from a Class II laser product, particularly under low ambient light conditions. This may have indirect general safety implications resulting from temporary disturbance of vision or from startle reactions. Such visual disturbances could be of particular concern when performing safety-critical operations. Provider Access Software users should not direct the Laser beam at persons or at reflective surfaces that may cause disturbances.</li>
            <li>It is recommended that Provider Access Software access is password protected via operating system's user account control. Only authorized users should have passwords, and users should safeguard passwords according to hospital policies and procedures, thereby preventing untrained users from obtaining access to the system.</li>
            <li>HIPAA regulation compliance requires that the storage of pictures be carefully managed. Consult the hospital’s HIPAA policy director for clarification.</li>
            <li>To avoid inadvertent disclosure of patient-related conversation, we recommend using the microphone mute button when conversing with someone alongside the Provider Access Software during a Remote Presence session.</li>
            <li>Collision avoidance sensors do not serve as a substitute for safe driving. Collision avoidance sensors do not always detect sharp drop-offs such as stairs. Do not attempt to drive the Patient Access Device down stairs and exercise extreme caution while driving near stairs.</li>
            <li>Become oriented with the Patient Access Device and its surroundings before driving. The Patient Access Device should not be driven in extremely close proximity to people (for example, person leaning against Patient Access Device, hugging Patient Access Device, etc.).</li>
            <li>While driving, always look in the direction the Patient Access Device is traveling and both ways at intersections. The driver is responsible for the safe operation of the Patient Access Device—please drive carefully.</li>
            <li>
                <p>The video images transmitted to and displayed on the Patient Access Device and Provider Access Software may not contain all of the information in the original scene. Video information from the camera is captured, compressed, transmitted, and redisplayed remotely at a different resolution. As a result information in the original scene may be lost.•Color reproduction in the transmitted video is not guaranteed. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Color reproduction in a video system is a complicated combination of lighting, cameras, and display technology. It should not be assumed that the colors on the display are an exact replication of the actual colors in the scene.</li>
            <li>Clinical judgment and experience are required to review and interpret images and information transmitted via the Patient Access Device and Provider Access Software.</li>
        </ul>
