        <h1>Safety Warnings and Cautions</h1>
        <div class="Note">
            <p><b class="Note">Warnings</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <MadCap:variable name="Cover Variables.Product Name" /> is not MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) safe, and therefore not MRI compatible. The <MadCap:variable name="Cover Variables.Product Name" /> should not be used in locations where the presence of metal is controlled.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Use of accessories, transducers and cables other than those specified or provided by the manufacturer of this equipment could result in increased electromagnetic emissions or decreased electromagnetic immunity of this equipment and result in improper operation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Portable RF communications equipment (including peripherals such as antenna cables and external antennas) should be used no closer than 30 cm (12 inches) to any part of the InTouch Thermal camera, including cables specified by InTouch Health. Otherwise, degradation of the performance of this eqiupment could result.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Flammable Anesthetics: The <MadCap:variable name="Cover Variables.Product Name" /> is not suitable for use in the presence of flammable anesthetic mixture with air, or in the presence of a flammable anesthetic mixtures with oxygen or nitrous oxide.</li>
                <li MadCap:conditions="Devices.Vici,Devices.Vantage,Devices.Vita,Devices.Xpress,Devices.TV,Devices.RP 7,General.Lite,General.Vita">The <MadCap:variable name="Cover Variables.Product Name" /> must be plugged into a grounded “Hospital Grade” electrical outlet to minimize the risk of electrical shock during the battery charging cycle.</li>
                <li MadCap:conditions="General.Vita,General.Lite,Devices.Vantage,Devices.Vici,Devices.Vita,Devices.Xpress,Devices.RP 7">If the power plug of the <MadCap:variable name="Cover Variables.Product Name" /> is damaged, the <MadCap:variable name="Cover Variables.Product Name" /> can be operated using the onboard battery system. However this condition should be reported to Technical Service immediately for repair.</li>
                <li MadCap:conditions="General.Lite,General.Vita,Devices.RP 7,Devices.Vantage,Devices.Vici,Devices.Vita,Devices.Xpress">The <MadCap:variable name="Cover Variables.Product Name" /> contains a sealed, rechargeable, lead-acid, AGM type battery. The <MadCap:variable name="Cover Variables.Product Name" /> should always be plugged in to avoid deep discharge cycles that can shorten the battery’s useful life. Other than keeping the batteries charged by keeping the <MadCap:variable name="Cover Variables.Product Name" /> plugged in, no user maintenance of the batteries is required.</li>
                <li MadCap:conditions="Devices.Xpress,Devices.Vita,Devices.Vici,Devices.Vantage,Devices.TVPro,General.Lite,General.Vita">Provide adequate ventilation. The <MadCap:variable name="Cover Variables.Product Name" /> may overheat if powered on or plugged in and charging while stored for extended periods in an area without adequate ventilation.</li>
                <li MadCap:conditions="General.Vita,General.Lite,Devices.RP 7,Devices.TV,Devices.TVPro,Devices.Vantage,Devices.Vici,Devices.Vita,Devices.Xpress">The power cord may pose a trip hazard if not properly secured prior to moving the <MadCap:variable name="Cover Variables.Product Name" />.</li>
                <li MadCap:conditions="Devices.Vita,Devices.Vici,Devices.Vantage,Devices.TVPro,Devices.RP 7,General.Lite,General.Vita">Avoid manually adjusting the camera's position. Doing so will reset the camera's default "Home", or resting, position. This can only be restored to the original front-facing centered view through the Provider Access Software.</li>
                <li MadCap:conditions="Devices.Xpress,Devices.Vita,Devices.Vici,Devices.Vantage,Devices.TVPro,Devices.TV,Devices.RP 7,Devices.Pro,Devices.Lite V3,Devices.Lite V1,General.Lite,General.Vita">Leakage current from interconnected electrical equipment may exceed safe levels. In order to maintain patient and user safety, it is important to interconnect only with devices in compliance with IEC 60601-1-1requirements. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that any interconnected equipment not supplied by InTouch Health maintains compliance with IEC 60601-1-1 requirements.</li>
                <li MadCap:conditions="General.Vita,General.Lite,Devices.RP 7,Devices.TV,Devices.TV&#160;Essential,Devices.TVPro,Devices.Vantage,Devices.Vici,Devices.Vita,Devices.Xpress">InTouch Patient Access Devices are designed to utilize the 802.11 ac/a/b/g/n communication protocol as well as the public Internet in order to achieve their intended purpose. Failures in either of these supporting systems could cause a complete loss of communication be-tween the Provider Access Software and the Patient Access Device. A tested backup method of communication should be available in the event network communication is lost.</li>
                <li>The video images transmitted to and displayed on the Patient Access Device and InTouch Provider Access Software may not contain all of the information in the original scene. Video information from the camera is captured, compressed, transmitted, and redisplayed re-motely at a different resolution. As a result, information in the original scene may be lost.</li>
                <li MadCap:conditions="General.Lite,General.Vita,Devices.TV,Devices.Vantage,Devices.Vici,Devices.Vita,Devices.Xpress">Color reproduction in the transmitted video is not guaranteed. Color reproduction in a video system is a complicated combination of lighting, cameras, and display technology. It should not be assumed that the colors on the display are an exact replication of the actual colors in the scene.</li>
                <li>Avoid reliance upon video systems for diagnosis and video teleconferencing. Limitations including those outlined above mean video conferencing is not a perfect substitute for in-person interaction with a trained care provider.</li>
                <li>Clinical judgment and experience are required to review and interpret images and information transmitted via the Patient Access Device and Provider Access Software.</li>
                <li MadCap:conditions="Devices.Vici,Devices.TVPro">An ESD event may cause the PTZ camera to stop outputting live video. If this should occur, unplug the <MadCap:variable name="Cover Variables.Product Name" /> from the wall, and cycle the <MadCap:variable name="Cover Variables.Product Name" /> power.</li>
                <li MadCap:conditions="Devices.Xpress,Devices.Vita,Devices.Vici,Devices.Vantage,General.Lite,General.Vita">Do not attempt to open or remove any parts of the <MadCap:variable name="Cover Variables.Product Name" />. To reduce the risk of electric shock, do not remove the cover. There are no user-serviceable components inside. Refer servicing and repair to qualified personnel only.</li>
                <li MadCap:conditions="Devices.Vantage,Devices.Vici,General.Lite"> Wheels may lock when <MadCap:variable name="Cover Variables.Product Name" /> is in motion if lock is engaged accidentally.</li>
                <li MadCap:conditions="General.Lite,Devices.Vantage,Devices.Vici"> <MadCap:variable name="Cover Variables.Product Name" /> may tip forward if pushed with too much force when wheels lock. Please take care when moving to avoid damage or injury.</li>
