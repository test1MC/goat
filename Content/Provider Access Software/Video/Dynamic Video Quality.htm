        <p>Users can <b>Enable advanced session video controls</b> which allows you to specify your preference for video quality.</p>
        <p class="NoteIndented">&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>    Click the <b>Options </b>button on the Provider Access Software dashboard to open the Options window.</li>
            <li>Click on the <b>Audio/Video</b> tab to bring it to the front.</li>
            <li>This checkbox is clear by default. Once enabled this setting will be remembered during future sessions for each Provider Access Software user.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Advanced Control - Video Preference1.jpg" class="floatright" />
        </p>
        <p>When advanced video controls are enabled, two new radio buttons will appear on the Network tab during a session as shown at the right.</p>
        <p>You can specify a preference for smoother motion or a sharper image. <b>Prefer smooth</b> <b>motion </b>is the default option and is always selected at the start of a session. <b>Prefer sharp</b> <b>image </b>will provide the highest possible video resolution within the available network bandwidth, but some choppiness may occur in scenes with motion, especially over low bandwidth connections.</p>
        <p><b>Recorded Video Compatibility Mode</b>: By default, videos are recorded in native InTouch Health mode providing the best possible quality. However, the output video may be compatible with external video players. We recommend using the latest Windows Media Player. This will not degrade the video quality of the session in any way. </p>
        <p class="NoteIndented">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Dynamic Video Quality Right Click Video Camera.jpg" class="floatright" />
        </p>
        <p>The right click menu of the Video Camera icon in the Remote Controls area allow the user to turn on the fixed-resolution <b>Compatibility Mode</b>. Video recorded in <b>Compatibility Mode</b> is always compatible with external viewers. The video recorded while in <b>Compatibility Mode</b> is recorded at 320x240, so recording in this mode may result in a lower quality video and may influence the video quality of the session during video recording.</p>
        <p class="Note"><b class="Note">NOTE</b>: Once a recording is started (whether by a Host or a Guest in a MultiPRESENCE®  session), the recording mode will not change.</p>
