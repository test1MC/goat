        <h2>Collision Avoidance</h2>
        <p>An array of sensors is placed around the Patient Access Device’s waist and at the base to help the driver “detect” when the Patient Access Device is nearing an object.</p>
        <p class="Note"><b class="Note">WARNING</b>: Collision avoidance sensors do not serve as a substitute for safe driving. Collision avoidance sensors do not always detect sharp drop-offs such as stairs. Do not attempt to drive the Patient Access Device down stairs and exercise extreme caution while driving near stairs.</p>
        <p class="Note"><b class="Note">NOTE</b>: Only the InTouch Vita’s sensors detect possible collisions and automatically slow or turn the InTouch Vita to avoid obstacles. Other drivable Patient Access Devices will stop only when their bumper is contacted.</p>
        <h2>Collision Avoidance Override (Nudge Mode)</h2>
        <p>The Patient Access Device is designed to allow you to push an obstacle or open a door by pushing on it (Nudge mode) using the bumpers. The collision avoidance feature can be overridden to drive in very tight spaces or to nudge an obstacle. The speed of the Patient Access Device is limited when using Nudge mode.</p>
        <p class="Note"><b class="Note">CAUTION</b>: When using Nudge mode, ensure that contact with the Patient Access Device is only at the bumpers on the base of the Patient Access Device. The Patient Access Device can be damaged if pushed into an obstacle against any part other than the bumpers.</p>
