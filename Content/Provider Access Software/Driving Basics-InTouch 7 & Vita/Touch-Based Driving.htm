        </p>
        <p>Touch-based manual driving is accomplished with a
vector key you can popup from the bottom of the
Remote Camera view. When the driving mode is
enabled the vector driving grid will appear showing
an image of the footprint of the Patient Access
Device and a speed/direction vector. The footprint
will turn orange when in Nudge mode. Refer to
“<MadCap:xref href="Collision Avoidance.htm" class="RelativeXref">Collision Avoidance on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>”.</p>
        <p>The vector key has four buttons to control the motion of the Patient Access Device. When you stop driving, the buttons will minimize after about 10 seconds.</p>

                        <h3>Slide Right</h3>
                        <p>Press the right arrow button and drag your finger to any point inside the Remote Camera View window and the Patient Access Device will slide to the right.</p>
                        <h3>Slide Left</h3>
                        <p>Press the left arrow button and drag your finger to any point inside the Remote Camera View window and the Patient Access Device will slide to the left.</p>
                        <p>Both of the slide buttons will always slide to the left or right in relation to the front of the Patient Access Device, not to the direction that the Head is facing (the camera view). If the Head is facing backwards, the slide buttons will move the Patient Access Device in the opposite direction from what is intuitively seen on the camera view. The slide speed is always set to slow.</p>
                        <h3>Driving Reverse</h3>
                        <p>Press the back arrow button and drag your finger to any point inside the Remote Camera View window. The Patient Access Device will first rotate its head to face backwards, and then drive backward. The reverse speed is always set to slow.</p>
                        <h3>Drive Forward/Turn</h3>
                        <p>Press and drag on the forward arrow button, the Patient Access Device will first rotate its head to face forward, and then drive forward. The green vector indicates the direction and speed you are commanding.</p>
