        <h2>Virtual Joystick Mouse-Based Driving</h2>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Manual driving with the mouse is accomplished with a vector key you can popup from the bottom of the Remote Camera view. The footprint will turn orange when in Nudge mode. Refer to “<MadCap:xref href="Collision Avoidance.htm" class="RelativeXref">Collision Avoidance on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>”.</p>
        <p>The vector key has four buttons to control the motion of the Patient Access Device. </p>
        <p>When you stop driving, the buttons will minimize after about 10 seconds.</p>

        <p class="NoteWImage" style="margin-right: 3in;"><b class="Note">NOTE</b>: The ﬁrst time you click on one of the arrow buttons you will see a warning message that these buttons will move the Patient Access Device. Select <b>Don’t show this again</b> to disable the warning in future sessions.</p>

        <h3>Slide Right</h3>
        <p>Click and hold on the right arrow button and the Patient Access Device will slide to the right.</p>
        <h3>Slide Left</h3>
        <p>Click and hold on the left arrow button and the Patient Access Device will slide to the left.</p>
        <p>Both of the slide buttons will always slide to the left or right in relation to the front of the Patient Access Device, not to the direction that the Head is facing (the camera view). If the Head is facing backwards, the slide buttons will move the Patient Access Device in the opposite direction from what is intuitively seen on the camera view. The slide speed is always set to slow.</p>
        <h3>Driving Reverse</h3>
        <p>Click and hold on the back arrow button, the Patient Access Device will ﬁrst rotate its head to face backwards, and then drive backward. The reverse speed is always set to slow.</p>
        <h3>Drive Forward/Turn</h3>
        <p>Click and “pull” on the forward arrow button. The Patient Access Device will ﬁrst rotate its head to face forward, and then drive forward. The green vector indicates the direction and speed you are commanding. The Patient Access Device will always attempt to turn and face the direction you are commanding; thereby always driving forward in the direction you see in the Remote Display.</p>
        <p class="Note"><b class="Note">NOTE</b>: If the Patient Access Device is in contact with an obstacle, it must be moved directly away from the obstacle until its bumper is free. In some cases it may be necessary to override the collision avoidance sensors to move the Patient Access Device. See “Collision Avoidance”.</p>
