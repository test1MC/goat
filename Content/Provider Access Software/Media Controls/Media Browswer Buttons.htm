        </p>
        <p>Media Browser buttons are used to scroll through media (both still images and videos) including both of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Media captured during the current session</li>
            <li>Previously saved media which has been opened during the current session</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Media Counter</h2>
        <p>The Media Counter displays information about media (still images and videos) which has been captured or reviewed (previously saved and opened for reviewing) during the current session.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>When a picture is displayed on the Patient Access Device Camera View, the Media Counter shows which image is displayed out of the total number of captured and reviewed media during the current session (e.g., 3 of 5).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/Video Playback Time Image.jpg" class="floatright" style="width: 321px;height: 200px;" />
        <p>When a video is displayed on the Patient Access Device Camera View or the Provider Access Software Camera View, the Media Counter shows information regarding the position in a video. The Video Playback Time is also displayed in the bottom left corner. </p>
        <p class="NoteIndented" style="text-align: center;">&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When a video is playing, the Media Counter shows the current location (in units of time) in the video and current frame of the video being viewed; i.e., hours: minutes: seconds. frame number.<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li><p class="NoteIndented">For example, when “0:00:03.26” is displayed in the media counter, the video is zero hours: zero minutes : three seconds : twenty-six frames into the video.</p></li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>While a video is recording, the Media Counter shows the progressive length of the recording measured in time and frames.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>When no media is being recorded, saved, shared, or reviewed, the Media Counter shows the number of media items captured or reviewed during the current session.</p>
