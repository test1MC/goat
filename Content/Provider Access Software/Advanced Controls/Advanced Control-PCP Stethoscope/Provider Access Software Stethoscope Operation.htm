        <p class="Note"><b class="Note">NOTE</b>: The Patient Access Device software’s priority is to guarantee that sound taken in from the Stethoscope is reproduced with complete fidelity on the Provider Access Software side. To achieve this, a buffering scheme is used to guard against Internet delays. This means that the audio which is heard from the Stethoscope is accurate, but is not exactly real-time; it is lagging about one second behind.</p>
