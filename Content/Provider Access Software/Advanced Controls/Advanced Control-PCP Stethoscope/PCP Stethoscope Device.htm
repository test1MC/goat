        <h1>PCP Stethoscope</h1>
        <p>Depending on the Patient Access Device you beam in to, you may see one of three different stethoscope configurations. The PCP stethoscope, installed on the InTouch Vita and some InTouch Lites, is described in this section. Some Patient Access Devices have an TR-1 Stethoscope or Littmann Bluetooth Stethoscope installed. Refer to “<MadCap:xref href="../Advanced Control-TR-1 Stethoscope/TR-1 Stethoscope Device.htm" class="RelativeXref">Advanced Controls - TR-1 Stethoscope Device on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>” or “<MadCap:xref href="../Advanced Controls-Littmann Bluetooth Stethoscope/Littmann Bluetooth Stethoscope Device.htm" class="RelativeXref">Littmann Bluetooth Stethoscope Device on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>”. The Stethoscope tab will let you know which Provider Access Software side stethoscope you need.</p>
        <h2>PCP Stethoscope Device </h2>
        <p>The stethoscope is an enhancement feature of the Patient Access Device that allows remote auscultation. When you beam in to a Patient Access Device that has a built-in Stethoscope, you will see the Stethoscope tab in the Advanced Controls section of the Dashboard.</p>
