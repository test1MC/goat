        <p>Select <b>Main focused</b> mode to allow the remote user to focus in on a specific conversation through 
the Patient Access Device. Ambient noise around the Patient Access Device is filtered out so that 
the Provider Access Software user can clearly hear the remote person that is in their direct line 
of sight.

        <h3>Main Immersive (InTouch Vantage V1 Only)
</h3>
        <p>Select <b>Main immersive</b> to enable the remote user to determine where sound is coming from. It is 
like using your own two ears, if someone standing behind you starts talking, you can tell their 
position relative to yourself.
