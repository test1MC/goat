        <h1>Littmann Bluetooth Stethoscope Device</h1>
        <p>Depending on the Patient Access Device you beam in to, you may see one of three different stethoscope configurations. The Littmann Bluetooth Stethoscope, available as an accessory component to the Lite V3, is described in this section. Other Patient Access Devices have a TR-1 Stethoscope or PCP Stethoscope installed. Refer to “<MadCap:xref href="../Advanced Control-TR-1 Stethoscope/TR-1 Stethoscope Device.htm" class="RelativeXref">Advanced Controls - TR-1 Stethoscope Device on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>” or “<MadCap:xref href="../Advanced Control-PCP Stethoscope/PCP Stethoscope Device.htm" class="RelativeXref">PCP Stethoscope on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>”. The Stethoscope tab will let you know which Provider Access
Software side stethoscope you need.</p>
        <h2>Littmann Bluetooth Stethoscope Device </h2>
        <p>The stethoscope is an enhancement feature of the Patient Access Device that allows remote auscultation. When you beam in to a Patient Access Device that has a built-in Stethoscope, you will see the Stethoscope tab in the Advanced Controls section of the Dashboard. </p>

        <p class="Note"><b class="Note">NOTE</b>: Providers must wear headsets to listen to auscultations. It is strongly recommended that Providers test headsets through the <MadCap:xref href="../../Provider Access Software Basics/Audio Video Wizard.htm" class="RelativeXref">Audio/Video Wizard on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref> before using them during consultations.</p>
