            <ul>
                <li> The Patient Access Device software’s priority is to guarantee that sound taken in from the 
Stethoscope is reproduced with complete fidelity on the Provider Access Software side. To achieve 
this, a buffering scheme is used to guard against Internet delays. This means that the audio which 
is heard from the Stethoscope is accurate, but is not exactly real-time; it is lagging about one 
second behind.
</li>
                <li>When a replacement battery is needed, the Stethoscope will be shown as unavailable on the 
Provider Access Software. Alert the patient or nurse attending the Patient Access Device to check 
the batteries if the Stethoscope is not available for use.
