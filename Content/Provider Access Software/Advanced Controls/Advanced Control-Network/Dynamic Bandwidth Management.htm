        <h2>Dynamic Bandwidth Management</h2>
        <p>The software employs a dynamic bandwidth mechanism whereby the bandwidth allotment changes over 
time depending on the network capabilities of each system. Network and wireless dropouts, as well 
as competition for bandwidth on a user’s network (or their ISP) may cause available bandwidth to 
decrease or increase, and the dynamic bandwidth mechanism will detect this and respond accordingly, 
as reflected by the green bar.

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The actual bandwidth use will fluctuate much more than the green bar, and may often be 
far below the green bar. This is because the video compression used varies substantially from frame 
to frame. In addition, certain cameras, particularly laptop cameras, are only capable of lower 
frame rates, and hence produce far less bandwidth. Also, variations in lighting, movement, and 
background patterns can cause substantial deviations in the bandwidth usage.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>An additional drop-down option in the lower right corner of the Network tab disables the dynamic 
bandwidth, while a fixed bandwidth is used instead. The fixed bandwidth options include <b>Medium</b>, <b>Low </b>
and <b>Lowest</b>. These should only be used in circumstances when multiple Remote Presence sessions are 
occurring simultaneously on the same limited network. Note that in the fixed mode, bandwidth will 
not adjust dynamically to changing network conditions, so even a <b>Medium </b>fixed level might be too 
high for
certain networks and result in poor network behavior.
