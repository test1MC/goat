        <h2>Optimizing Bandwidth Usage</h2>
        <p class="NoteIndented">

        <p>The Network tab displays the amount of bandwidth being used, both sent and received. These are shown as numerical values (in white text) on top of a gray bar which displays the values graphically. The <b>Sent </b>bandwidth includes all data (video, audio, and control) sent to the Patient Access Device, as well as to other Provider Access Software users in a MultiPRESENCE® session. The <b>Received </b>bandwidth includes all data (video, audio, and sensor) sent by the Patient Access Device to the Provider Access Software users.</p>

        <p class="Note"><b class="Note">NOTE</b>: In a MultiPRESENCE® session, when a Provider Access Software user (typically a Guest) is not projecting full-screen video to the Patient Access Device, their <b>Sent </b>bandwidth usage will be very low.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.PDF">&#160;</p>
        <p>There are times when the bandwidth limitation of one party in a particular session dramatically affects the video quality for all the other participants. In these cases, if the responsible party is a Guest, the Host may want to prevent video from being sent to that Guest, in order to improve the experience of the other users.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.PDF">&#160;</p>
        <p>When the mouse hovers over the <b>Sent </b>area, a tooltip pops up which displays the responsible party for the low bandwidth being sent by that Provider Access Software.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.PDF">&#160;</p>
        <p>On the Host interface, when the mouse hovers over the <b>Received </b>area, a tooltip displays the responsible party for the low bandwidth being sent by the Patient Access Device. (Note that low bandwidth results in poorer video quality; more specifically a low frame rate.) The Host then has the option of right-clicking on a Guest’s thumbnail and disallowing them from seeing the Patient Access Device video or disconnecting them from the session entirely.</p>
