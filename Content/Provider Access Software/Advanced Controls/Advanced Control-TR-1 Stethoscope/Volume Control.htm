        <h2>Volume Control</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 11pt;">It is important to note that local volume controls exist on both the Provider Access Software and 
TR-1 Stethoscope units. These volume controls affect ONLY the volume of the headset attached to 
them. Alteration of the volume control on the TR-1 Stethoscope unit will NOT change the volume on 
the your headset. This must be done at the Provider Access Software.

            <ul>
                <li>Audio routes through a completely separate channel from the Stethoscope sound, hence one can 
talk and hear normally through the Patient Access Device at the same time one is listening to the 
Stethoscope, if desired.
</li>
                <li style="font-size: 11pt;">A common problem encountered when using the Stethoscope is that the Provider Access Software volume 
may be set too high. Due to the enhanced sensitivity of the TR-1 Stethoscope device, the volume 
control should only be turned about a quarter of the way up (to the 9 o’clock position). Refer to 
the TR-1 Stethoscope documentation for more information.
</li>
                <li>As with the volume control knob, separate Diaphragm &amp; Bell controls exist on both the 
Provider Access Software and TR-1 Stethoscope units which affect ONLY what is heard through the 
headset attached to them. Refer to the TR-1 documentation for more information on the operation
of the Stethoscope unit.
