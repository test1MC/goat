        <h1> TR-1 Stethoscope Device</h1>
        <p>Depending on the Patient Access Device you beam in to, you may see one of three diﬀerent stethoscope conﬁgurations. The TR-1 stethoscope, installed on the InTouch 7, InTouch 7i, some InTouch Lites, and available on the InTouch Xpress as add-on equipment, is described in this section. Some Patient Access Devices have a PCP Stethoscope or Littmann Bluetooth Stethoscope installed. Refer to “<MadCap:xref href="../Advanced Control-PCP Stethoscope/PCP Stethoscope Device.htm" class="RelativeXref">PCP Stethoscope on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>” or “<MadCap:xref href="../Advanced Controls-Littmann Bluetooth Stethoscope/Littmann Bluetooth Stethoscope Device.htm" class="RelativeXref">Littmann Bluetooth Stethoscope Device on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>”.The Stethoscope tab will let you know which Provider Access Software side stethoscope you need.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The TR-1 Stethoscope is an enhancement feature of the Patient Access Device that allows remote auscultation. When you beam in to a Patient Access Device that has a built-in Stethoscope, you will see the Stethoscope tab in the Advanced Controls section of the Dashboard. If you see the Stethoscope tab shown below, you have the TR-1 device and you will need to have the Provider Access Software Stethoscope unit and software drivers installed on your computer.
