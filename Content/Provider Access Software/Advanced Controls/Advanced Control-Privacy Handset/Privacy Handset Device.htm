        <p>The Privacy Handset is for use in conversations that require privacy or understandability in a loud environment. When the Privacy Handset is enabled, the standard Patient Access Device audio system is disabled. This means the microphone is not active and the Patient Access Device speaker is not active. When the Privacy Handset is disabled, the audio system is transferred from the phone, back to the standard Patient Access Device audio system.</p>
        <p class="NoteWImage" style="margin-right: 2.5in;"><b class="Note">NOTE</b>: The Privacy Handset can only be turned on or oﬀ by the Provider Access Software.</p>
