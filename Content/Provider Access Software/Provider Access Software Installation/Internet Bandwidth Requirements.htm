        <h2>Internet Bandwidth Requirements</h2>
        <p>Internet access with sufficient bandwidth to use the Remote Presence System is required. This is generally accomplished with a broadband Internet connection having minimum upload and download speeds of 300 kbps.
</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If the desired location has Internet access:
<ul><li> The bandwidth must be measured to ensure it meets the necessary broadband speed requirements. To do so, web sites such as <a href="http://www.pcpitstop.com/internet" target="_blank">www.pcpitstop.com/internet</a> or <a href="https://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest/" target="_blank">https://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest/</a> are used to run upload and download broadband tests.
</li><li> If the upload and download speeds are above 300 kbps (during the time of day when use is anticipated), then the Internet connection is adequate for the Remote Presence System application.
</li><li> If either the upload or download speed is below 300 kbps, then the Internet connection will need to be upgraded to a higher bandwidth through the local ISP provider.
</li><li> Once the appropriate broadband is available, an InTouch Health representative can provide assistance with configuring your computer for optimal performance.
</li></ul></li>
            <li>If the desired location does not have Internet access:<ul><li>The first option is to check with the local cable provider for high-speed Internet access.</li><li>If not available, then service plans with ISP providers in the area will need to be researched.</li></ul></li>
        </ol>
        <p>In many cases InTouch Health personnel are available to assist with these tasks. However, the primary user or designate may need to be available to work with InTouch Health personnel or provide access to the Provider Access Software location (home, office or clinic) during or outside of normal business hours. When working with ISP providers, they ALWAYS require the primary holder of the account to be present or a designate to identify themselves via private information (e.g., Social Security Number).</p>
