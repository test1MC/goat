        <h1>Software Installation</h1>
        <p>When planning for the Provider Access Software installation, there are several things to keep in</p>
        <p>mind.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A specific location for your computer must be determined, taking into account the desk space required, proximity to both an Internet connection and an electrical outlet, and the general lighting in the room.</li>
            <li>  The HIPAA privacy regulations with respect to using Remote Presence Systems must be understood. A broadband Internet connection with the appropriate bandwidth for optimal system performance is required.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Space and Location Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Desktop Space</b>: To use the Provider Access Software, your computer should have various components which sit easily on a desktop. The minimum desktop area required for a desktop computer is 30” (width) x 24” (depth). The minimum desktop area required for a laptop computer 18” (width) x 14” (length).</li>
            <li><b>Seating</b>: A chair for comfortable seating while viewing the screen is required.</li>
            <li><b>Lighting</b>: Your computer should be located in a room where there is good lighting. Ideally, any window in the room would NOT be behind the operator but to one side of the setup, as the reflection of light, if coming from directly behind the operator, can interfere with proper camera operation.</li>
            <li><b>Power &amp; Internet</b>: Your computer will require power. A nearby Ethernet port (RJ45 jack) for connection to the Internet is also required. Please note that wireless Internet connection is not recommended for the Provider Access Software.</li>
        </ul>
