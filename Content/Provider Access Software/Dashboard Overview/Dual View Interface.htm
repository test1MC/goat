        <p>The Provider Access Software Dual View Interface provides for two remote camera views. This interface retains some of the same Advanced Controls and Local Controls functionality as the normal interface, however several buttons and panels do not appear:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The battery meter is not shown.</li>
            <li>The only Local Controls are Live and the microphone controls.</li>
            <li>The mouse can be used to control the Patient Access Device depending on the functionality of the selected camera (highlighted in yellow on the top and bottom of the camera view).</li>
            <li>The Provider Access Software display resolution must be set to 1280 x 800 or greater for the Dual View to work. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To switch to the Dual View interface, click <b>Dual View</b>, or click on the <b>Aux Video</b> tab of the Advanced Controls and select the view you would like to see on each side of the Provider Access Software dashboard.</p>
        <p>To return back to the normal interface click <b>Normal interface</b> or press the <b>Esc </b>key.</p>
        <p class="Note"><b class="Note">NOTE</b>: You can record both video feeds in Dual Screen view. Press <b>REC </b>to begin recording.</p>
