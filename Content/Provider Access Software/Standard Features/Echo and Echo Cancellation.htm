        <h2>Echo and Echo Cancellation</h2>
        <p>A person at the Provider Access Software or near a Patient Access Device in session may hear an echo of the person speaking. This could happen if the computer with Provider Access Software has external speakers that are loud or if the Provider Access Software does not have echo cancellation enabled. Using a headset with the Provider Access Software will remove the echo. InTouch Health recommends that all Provider Access Software users wear a headset for the best quality and experience.</p>
