        <h2>Virtual Joystick Mouse-Based Video</h2>
        <p>The Patient Access Device utilizes a dual-camera system to obtain both the greatest ﬁeld of view for driving and the maximum zoom capability during Remote Presence sessions. When zooming in or out, the application automatically switches to the appropriate camera for the desired focus.</p>
        <p>(You may notice a slight visual shift when this occurs.) On the Zoom slide control bar, this transition occurs when the slider is moved between the blue and yellow portions of the bar.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The mouse may be used to control the Remote Camera view using Point-to-See, the BoxZoom function, or the mouse scroll-wheel.</p>
        <h3>Point-to-See</h3>
        <p>A left click of the mouse anywhere on the Remote Camera View centers focus to that location.</p>

        </p>
        <h3>Box Zoom</h3>
        <p>Left click at the center of what you want to view, then hold and drag the Mouse cursor over the area to be enlarged, and then release the Mouse button. This zooms in on the selected area.</p>

            <p><b class="Note">NOTE</b>: Box zoom is only available on 4th generation iOS Viewpoint Patient Access Devices and newer, including the iPad Mini, Air and Pro.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Scroll Wheel Zoom</h3>
        <p>Zoom In - Roll the mouse scroll wheel forward.</p>
        <p>Zoom Out - Roll the mouse scroll wheel back.</p>
        <h3>Return to Full View</h3>
        <p>If zoomed in using any means, a right click of the mouse anywhere on the Remote Camera view zooms out to full view.</p>
