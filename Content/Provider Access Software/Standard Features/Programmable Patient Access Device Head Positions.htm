        <p>The Provider Access Software has nine preset Patient Access Device Head positions that can be accessed by pressing any F key from F4 through F12 on your keyboard. The diagram on the right shows the preset positions and their associated F keys. When a specific key is pressed, the Patient Access Device Head will move to face the direction indicated, at an angle parallel to the floor.</p>
        <h3>Setting Preferred Positions</h3>
        <p>Any of the nine preset positions can be overridden and replaced during a session.</p>

            <li>Each time the programmed F key is pressed during that session, it will now return to the preferred location and zoom.</li>
