        <h2>Sharing Media with Guests</h2>

        <p>Once shared, Host and Guests can all telestrate on the media to point out areas of interest to each other. Each user’s default telestration color will be different. See <MadCap:xref href="../Pictures/Sharing Pictures.htm" class="RelativeXref">Sharing Pictures on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>.

        <p>The Host shares this image with the Patient Access Device as well by clicking <b>Share Media</b> ; then to the prompt.</p>
