        <p>In some situations, the Host may wish to force all Guests on at all times to use the Push-to-Talk button. These situations include distracting background noise or a user without a headset interfering with communication during a session.

        <p>By selecting <b>Host forces Push-to-talk on all MultiPRESENCE guests</b>, the Host requires that all Guests use the Push-to-Talk button when speaking.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click the <b>Options </b>button on the Provider Access Software dashboard to open the Options window, then select the <b>Audio/Video</b> tab.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>This checkbox is unchecked by default. But once enabled will be remembered during future sessions for each Provider Access Software user when they are the Host in a MultiPRESENCE session.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b class="Note">NOTE</b>: The Host can set or change this option at anytime. If the Host changes this option during a MultiPRESENCE session, the Guest will be notified and the Push to Talk button will either appear or be removed as appropriate.</p>
