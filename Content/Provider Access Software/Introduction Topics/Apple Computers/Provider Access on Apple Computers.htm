        <h2>Using Provider Access Software on Apple Computers</h2>
        <p>MacBook Pro, iMac, and MacBook Air users who would like to be able to use the Provider Access Software on their computers must either partition their hard drive or install the third party software Parallels and install Windows 7 on their machine.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Windows 7 and Windows 10 is supported.</li>
            <li>Windows XP and Windows 8 are <b>not </b>supported.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The most reliable way to use the Provider Access Software on an Apple computer is by installing the software on a Boot Camp partitioned hard drive running Windows 7. It is highly recommended that the Macintosh Operating System be upgraded to at least Version 10.10 (Yosemite). Running a Virtual Machine software such as Parallels (version 9.0 or higher) is also supported.</p>
