        <h1>Secondary Provider</h1>
        <p>A Secondary Provider is a role in <MadCap:variable name="Scheduler.Product Name" /> that is assigned to a member of the medical staff to allow them to remotely access a patient for the purpose of a preliminary consult prior to the primary Provider's consult. The Secondary Provider is notified to do their preliminary remote consult by the Medical Assistant after the patient's vitals are taken. After the Secondary Provider completes their preliminary consult, they can then transfer the patient to the primary Provider and notify the Provider that the patient is ready for consultation. The primary Provider can then complete the remote consultation. </p>
        <p>The Secondary Provider's role is assigned by the System Administrator and has the same system functionality as a Provider. Each Secondary Provider is assigned to one or more Providers and a provider can have one or more Secondary Providers.</p>
