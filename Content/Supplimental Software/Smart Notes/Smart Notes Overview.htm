        <h1><MadCap:variable name="Smart Notes.Product Name" /> Overview</h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Smart Notes.Product Name" /> Module is built upon the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Health.InTouch Operating System" />.  <MadCap:variable name="Smart Notes.Product Name" /> is a documentation tool for telehealth consults with customizable, provider based applications, which safely and securely collects, stores and aggregates patient data. Collected data provides telehealth program administrators the ability to discover actionable insights and drive measurable results.

</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Smart Notes.Product Name" /> can be leveraged across all telehealth point of care, including Acute, Non-Acute, and Community Based care.  </p>
        <p>For example, when a patient is identified as a possible stroke patient, medical staff users create an encounter using <MadCap:variable name="Smart Notes.Product Name" /> to establish the encounter information, allowing for the capture of valuable data including vitals, labs, history, symptoms, medications, and other data. 

</p>
        <p>Providers can easily access the encounter and begin to capture valuable and pertinent encounter  data during the patient assessment. Once the encounter is completed, providers review aggregated data previously entered into the encounter, and then electronically sign a <b>Consultation Note</b>. </p>
        <p><b>Consultation Notes</b> are time  stamped, formatted into a PDF, and then can be automatically distributed to the patient's EHR, Medical Records, Billing or the location where patient care was delivered. </p>
        <p>Alerts and notifications can be immediately delivered to medical offices, onsite providers, remote physicians and Emergency Department staff, indicating an encounter was completed or the results of the encounter are available for review. <b>Consultation Notes</b> can also be automatically faxed, downloaded, printed, or delivered to the patients EHR with an HL7 integration message. </p>
