            <h2>Date and Time Stamp</h2>
            <p>This field has a formatted input mask which uses characters or symbols to define the input of the day, month, year, and time resulting in improved data integrity. Clicking the Now button timestamps that field with the current date and time in the patient’s local time.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Reference Field</h2>
        <p>A reference field displays a field from another part of the application. For example, Last Known Well type from the Patient Info page is referenced on the Recommendations page. Once you define a reference field, the system creates a relationship to display the referenced field in another page of the application.</p>
        <div class="NoBreak">
            <h2>Conditional Visibility</h2>
            <p>This control enables the visibility or hiding of another field on-the-fly when certain conditions are met. For example, when Last Known Well Time is ‘Known’, the ‘Time’ stamp become visible along with ‘Type’ and other questions pertaining to the patients stroke symptoms.</p>
