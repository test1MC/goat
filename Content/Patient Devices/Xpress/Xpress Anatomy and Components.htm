        <h3>Auxiliary Ports</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Audio Line In and Audio Line Out ports.</li>
            <li>Composite Video and S-Video connectors (NTSC Auxiliary Video input ports) which allow the Provider Access user to view auxiliary video through the Provider Access application. These video input ports can be configured to support PAL by InTouch Health Technical Support.</li>
            <li>Ethernet network ports (two).</li>
            <li>The VGA Out allows the video from the Provider Access Software (shown on the RP-Xpress display) to be shown on a different screen or shown by a projector, by InTouch Health Technical Support.</li>
            <li>Additional connectors are used by InTouch Health personnel for maintenance, upgrades, and servicing.</li>

            <p><b class="Note">WARNINGS</b>: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The video images transmitted to and displayed on the Xpress and Provider Access Software may not contain all of the information in the original scene. Video information from the camera is captured, compressed, transmitted, and redisplayed remotely at a different resolution. As a result information in the original scene may be lost.</li>
                <li>Color reproduction in the transmitted video is not guaranteed. Color reproduction in a video system is a complicated combination of lighting, cameras, and display technology. It should not be assumed that the colors on the display are an exact replication of the actual colors in the scene.</li>
                <li>Clinical judgment and experience are required to review and interpret images and information transmitted via the Xpress and Provider Access Software.</li>

            <p><b class="Note">Cautions</b>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adding third party software or hardware to the Xpress is not supported. All hardware and software must be validated by InTouch Health as part of the Xpress Class II Medical Device clearance. Contact InTouch Health Technical Service prior to installing any third party software or hardware.</li>
                <li>Do not leave video equipment connected to the auxiliary ports. The equipment and/or the Xpress may be damaged if the Xpress is moved with the equipment connected to an auxiliary port.</li>
