        <p class="Note"><b class="Note">CAUTION</b>: A tested backup method of communication should be made available in case the network communication is lost. The Xpress is designed to utilize the 802.11 WiFi communication protocol, cellular broadband as well as the public Internet in order to achieve its intended purpose. Failures in any of these supporting systems could cause a complete loss of communication between the Provider Access Software and the Xpress. Consequently, the Xpress should not be utilized in any activities where successful completion of the activity is dependent upon uninterrupted communication between the Xpress and the Provider Access Software.</p>
        <h2>Integrated Connectivity</h2>
        <p>The Xpress can connect to the Internet using 4G cellular broadband through MiFi or other devices capable of creating WiFi hotspots. The cellular service provider may change from area to area. Customers should contact InTouch Health Technical Service for further information.</p>
