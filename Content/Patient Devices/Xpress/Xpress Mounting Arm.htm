        <h2>Xpress Mounting Arm Operation
</h2>
        <p>The Xpress can be mounted on the arm shown below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The lever locks all three pivot points.</li>
            <li>The quick release mounting plate has a secondary lock to disable the quick release function.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align: left;">

        </p>
        <p>Directions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Secure the arm clamp to an appropriate support.</li>
            <li>Hold the platform (or Xpress handle) and unlock the Lock Release lever to set the location of the mounting platform. The mounting platform should be parallel to the ground for best results.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Note"><b class="Note">CAUTION</b>: When the Lock Release lever is unlocked, all three pivot points are freed to move. Support the Xpress with its handle when repositioning so that it does not fall.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Lock the release lever.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="Note">
            <p><b class="Note">Warnings</b>: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Xpress mounting arm is adjusted at the factory to securely hold the Xpress steady under a vertical acceleration of 3 gravities with a moment arm of 10 inches (25.4 cm). To reduce the risk of injury, do not extend the mounting arm platform further than 10 inches (25.4 cm) from the base mounting point.</li>
                <li>To prevent the possibility of injury, do not secure the Xpress Mounting Arm to any support structure within 36 inches (91.4 cm) of a patient’s head or critical areas.</li>
            </ul>
