        <p class="Anchor">&#160;</p>
        <p class="Body1">The Remote Presence System is a telecommunications platform that enables an individual to “be in two places at once.” Remote Presence is the ability to project yourself to another location (without leaving your current location) and to see, hear, and talk as though you were actually there. </p>
        <p class="Body1">A Remote Presence System is comprised of <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.CS" /> and a <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" />. The CS and <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" /> are linked via the Internet over a secure broadband connection. The RP Endpoint’s two-way audio and video communications allows a user to now be remotely available at the point of interaction whenever they are needed. </p>
        <p class="Body1">While seated at the ControlStation an individual can access the RP Endpoint to visit people in another location. A physician can call on a patient, family members and other staff. Moreover, via the ControlStation, the operator may access any web-based information such as hospital electronic medical records (EMR), simultaneously viewing this data while interacting with the person at the remote location. </p>
        <p class="Body1">The family of Remote Presence Systems includes the RP-7<span class="SuperScript" style="font-family: Symbol;">â</span> and RP-7i<span class="SuperScript" style="font-family: Symbol;">â</span>, which are drivable, free-roaming RP Endpoint that enable complete mobility at the remote site and the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.RobotName" />, which implements a Remote Presence System tailored for the operating room environment.</p>
