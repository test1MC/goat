        <h1>Main Power - Recharging the InTouch Lite</h1>
        <p>On the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Lite V1" /> and V2, the Main Power switch panel is located on the
right side of the expansion bay near the Privacy
Handset. On the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Lite" /> V3, the battery charge
indicator is located above the Expansion Bay. </p>
        <p>The Main Power switch panel contains
the main power button, battery charge indicator
lights, and the low-power alarm reset button.
</p>
        <p>The Main Power button turns on the power to the
Lite (V1 and V2) and the Auxiliary AC Power
Receptacle. If the Lite is not plugged in, the power
is provided from the battery.</p>
        <div class="Note"><b class="Note">NOTE</b>: The <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Lite" /> V3 does not have a Main Power switch. All power is integrated and controlled through the Button Panel.</div>
        <p>The Battery charge lights will be lit indicating the remaining percentage of battery life whenever the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Lite" /> is plugged in or turned on.</p>
        <p>If the battery charge drops below the alarm threshold, the sound-byte “<b class="ScreenItem">Please plug me in</b>” will be played at intervals until the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Lite" /> is plugged into AC power. Plug in the device as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Lite" /> should be plugged in and left powered on at all times. Plug the Lite into a grounded “Hospital Grade” electrical outlet to minimize the risk of electrical shock during the battery charging cycle.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The system will charge to 85% in four hours.</li>
            <li>The system will charge to 100% in six hours.</li>
        </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li style="orphans: 2;widows: 2;">If the power plug of the Lite is damaged, the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Lite" /> can be operated using the on-board battery system. Report this condition to Technical Service immediately for repair.</li>
                    <li style="orphans: 2; widows: 2;">The <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Lite" /> contains sealed, rechargeable, lead-acid, gel-type batteries. The <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Lite" /> should always be plugged in to avoid deep discharge cycles that can shorten the battery’s useful life. Other than keeping the batteries charged by keeping the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Lite" /> plugged in, no user maintenance of the batteries is required.</li>
