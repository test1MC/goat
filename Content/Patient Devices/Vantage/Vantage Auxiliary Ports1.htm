                <p><b class="Note">CAUTIONS</b>: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not connect any auxiliary equipment to the InTouch Vantage that would cause or lead to penetration of a sterile field if the InTouch Vantage is moved by a remote user or otherwise.
</li>
                    <li> Observe the overhead Boom when moving or adjusting the position of the InTouch Vantage. Overhead objects such as lights, can be damaged by unexpected collisions.
</li>
                    <li>Do not pull down or place any heavy objects on the Boom, especially when the Boom is extended.
</li>
                    <li> Avoid the labeled pinch points on the InTouch Vantage, especially when operating the lifting mechanism, when extending or folding the Boom, and during remote sessions when the InTouch Vantage head and the Boom Camera can be moved by a remote user.
</li>
                    <li>The InTouch Vantage is not being provided sterile and any potential peripherals attached to the InTouch Vantage may not be provided sterile.</li>
