        <h1>Pan/Tilt/Zoom Boom Camera</h1>
        <p>The InTouch Vantage Pan/Tilt/Zoom (PTZ) Boom Camera system includes a Camera/Microphone, a
Display, and a remote control. The Boom Camera system is powered on whenever the Main power is
on. If either the Camera or the Display is turned off (amber standby light is lit), then the component
must be turned on. When on (green power light is lit), the Boom Camera will immediately send video to
the Boom Display.</p>

        <h2>Boom Camera and Microphone</h2>
        <p>The Boom Camera and Microphone are located at the end of the InTouch Vantage Boom. The video selection and microphone selection are both controlled through the Provider Access Software application.</p>
        <h2>Boom Camera Display</h2>
        <p>The Boom Camera Display displays video from the Boom Camera. Once the Display Power button is on, the Display will turn on whenever power is applied. There is no audio associated with the Display.</p>
