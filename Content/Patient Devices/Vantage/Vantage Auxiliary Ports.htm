                <ul>
                    <li>The video images transmitted to and displayed on the InTouch Vantage and Provider Access Software may not contain all of the information from the original scene. Video information from the camera is captured, compressed, transmitted, and redisplayed remotely at a different resolution. As a result information from the original scene may be lost.</li>
                    <li>Color reproduction in the transmitted video is not guaranteed. Color reproduction in a video system is a complicated combination of lighting, cameras, and display technology. It should not be assumed that the colors on the display are an exact replication of the actual colors in the scene.</li>
                    <li>Clinical judgment and experience are required to review and interpret images and information transmitted via the InTouch Vantage and Provider Access Software.</li>
