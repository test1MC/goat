        <h1>Privacy Handset</h1>
        <p>The Privacy Handset is for use in conversations that
require privacy or understandability in a loud
environment. When the Privacy Handset is enabled,
the standard Vita audio system is disabled. This
means the Vita microphone is not active, and the Vita
speaker is not active. When the Privacy Handset is
disabled, the audio system is transferred from the
handset, back to the standard Vita audio system.</p>
