            <li>Put on gloves.</li>

        <h2>Vita Stethoscope Headset</h2>
        <p>Using the Vita headset is optional, but it may be used to assist with placement of the chest piece on the patient or as an aid for teaching/mentoring. The Vita headset allows the nurse, resident, fellow, etc. to listen to the Stethoscope while still being able to hear the normal Vita audio and other sounds in the environment.</p>
        <h2>Technical Service—Stethoscope</h2>
        <p>If a problem should arise in regard to use of the PCP Stethoscope on the Vita, please contact InTouch Health Technical Service, so that Technical Service can determine the source of the issue. Questions about the PCP Stethoscope controls can be answered by reference to the PCP Stethoscope manual shipped with the Stethoscope kits. Should a chest piece or headset cable break, contact InTouch Health Technical Service for assistance.</p>
        <p><b class="Note">CAUTION</b>: Do not pull on the cables, and do not pull the Vita using the cables as cables may break, especially near the junction points with the Vita.</p>
