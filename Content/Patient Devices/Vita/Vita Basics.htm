        <h2>Charging the <MadCap:variable name="TV.Vita" /></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Vita will charge to 80% in two hours.</li>
            <li>Vita will charge to 100% in six hours.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="Note">Note</b>: Vita should be docked whenever it is not in use.</p>
        <p>The Vita can be sent to its Dock from the Provider Access Software or by hospital personnel using the Touch-Screen Chest Display. See AutoDRIVE.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If Dock is not available for any reason and Vita needs to be charged, plug the Vita into a standard grounded outlet.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b class="Note">NOTE</b>: The power plug has an internal light which lights when plugged into a live outlet. Ensure it is lit when charging with the power plug.</p>
        <p><b class="Note">CAUTION</b>: The Vita contains high capacity rechargeable, Lithium-Ion batteries. The Vita should be plugged in when not in use so it is fully charged and ready for the next consult and to avoid deep discharge cycles that can shorten the battery’s useful life. Other than keeping the batteries charged by keeping the Vita plugged in, no user maintenance of the batteries is required.</p>
        <h2>Charging Status Indicator Lights</h2>
        <p>The Vita Dock has an LED indicator light located on the top of the Dock. In addition, the power plug contains a light which turn on when plugged into a live AC outlet.</p>

        <h2>Power Controls</h2>
        <p>The Vita has two power controls:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the Rocker Switch (main On/Off switch), that controls power from either the wall plug or the</li>
            <li>batteries; and</li>
            <li>the Vita Computer Power Button.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Rocker Switch is located just below the skirt on the base, above the Docking Charger Interface.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Rocker Switch, which remains in either the Off or On position, controls the power to the Vita. If the Vita is neither plugged in nor docked, the power is provided from the battery. The Vita Rocker Switch should stay On, except during storage, service, transport, or to avoid depleting the battery.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2>Power On Sequence</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Plug Vita in at its docking station or plug the power cord into an approved wall socket.</li>
            <li>Switch the Rocker Switch to the On position.</li>
            <li>Turn On the power to the computer:<ul><li>Press and hold in the Computer Power Button for about half of a second.</li><li>Check to ensure the display powers up successfully.</li><li>After a period of self-testing (1-2 minutes), the screen saver should appear on the display.</li></ul></li>
        </ol>
        <p><b class="Note">Note</b>: The Vita should be docked (or plugged in) and left powered on at all times.</p>

        <p><b class="Note">CAUTIONs</b>: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To ensure system readiness, connectivity, and charged batteries, power on the Vita at least two hours before its intended use.</li>

            <li>the Vita Computer Power Button which controls only the computer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="Note">CAUTION</b>: When powering down the Vita for any reason, always ensure that the Computer Power Button is powered off first and that the Vita Display screen turns off (turns black) before turning off the Rocker Switch.
