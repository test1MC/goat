        </p>
        <p>The Privacy Handset is for use in conversations that
require privacy or understandability in a loud
environment. When the Privacy Handset is enabled,
the standard Vita audio system is disabled. This
means the Vita microphone is not active, and the Vita
speaker is not active. When the Privacy Handset is
disabled, the audio system is transferred from the
handset, back to the standard Vita audio system.</p>
        <p><b class="Note">Notes</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Privacy Handset can only be turned on or off from the Provider Access Software.</li>
            <li>It is important to return the Privacy Handset to the hook on the Vita.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="Note">CAUTION</b>: Do not allow the Privacy Handset to drag behind the Vita. Place it on the hook after use and close the Storage bay door for safe Vita driving.</p>
