        </p>
        <p>The Vita’s expansion bay includes both video input
ports and a VGA output port. The USB ports can also
serve to capture video from approved USB cameras.
This allows the remote physician to view multiple
video inputs through the Provider Access Software.
The VGA output allows the video from the Provider
Access (shown on the Vita remote display) to be
shown on a different screen or on a projector.
</p>
        <p><b class="Note">WARNINGS</b>: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The video images transmitted to and
displayed on the Vita and Provider Access may
not contain all of the information in the original
scene. Video information from the camera is
captured, compressed, transmitted, and
redisplayed remotely at a different resolution. As
a result information in the original scene may be
lost.
</li>
            <li>Color reproduction in the transmitted
video is not guaranteed. Color reproduction in a video system is a complicated combination of
lighting, cameras, and display technology. It should not be assumed that the colors on the display
are an exact replication of the actual colors in the scene.
 </li>
            <li>Clinical judgment and experience are required to review and interpret images and
information transmitted via the Vita and Provider Access.
</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="ScreenItem">CAUTION</b>: Always push the Emergency Stop button in when connecting video equipment to the
Auxiliary Video Input. Disconnect the equipment when ending a session and before pulling the
Emergency Stop button out to enable the Vita’s (base) movements. The Vita has Autonomous drive
modes that will be commanded when it is not in session. For example, the Vita will return to its
Dock when its battery charge is running low. The Vita and/or attached equipment may be damaged
if the Vita is driven with equipment connected to its Inputs.</p>
