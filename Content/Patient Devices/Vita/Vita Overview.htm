        <p><b class="Note">caution: </b>Dazzle, flash-blindness, and afterimages may be<b class="Note"> <![CDATA[ ]]></b>caused by a beam from a Class II laser product, particularly under low ambient light conditions. This may have indirect general safety implications resulting from temporary disturbance of vision or from startle reactions. Such visual disturbances could be of particular concern connected with performing safety-critical operations. Users should not stare at the beam and perform active protective reactions by moving the head or closing the eyes to avoid continued intrabeam viewing. </p>
