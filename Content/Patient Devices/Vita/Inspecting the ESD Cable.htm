        <h1>Inspecting the ESD Cable</h1>
        <p>The ESD cable is located on the underside of the Vita to dissipate any static charges that arise, for example when the Vita is driven over carpeted surfaces. The cable should be checked periodically to ensure that it is present and remains in contact with the floor.</p>
        <p><b class="Note">CAUTION</b>: Do not tilt Vita onto its bumpers or attempt to place Vita on its back. The bumpers located on the bottom edge of Vita may be damaged.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tilt the Vita toward the back on its roller wheels so that the static cable can be viewed.</li>
            <li>Verify  the cable is relatively straight and not kinked as shown in the photograph.</li>
            <li>Verify that the cable reaches the floor when the Vita is upright.</li>
        </ul>
