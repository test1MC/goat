        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Safety Intro.flsnp" />
        <h2>Safety Warnings</h2>
        <p><b class="Note">WARNINGS</b>: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><MadCap:variable name="ClinicalApps.CompanyName" /> <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" />s are not MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) safe, and therefore not MRI compatible. Do not be use in locations where the presence of metal is controlled.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Flammable Anesthetics: <MadCap:variable name="ClinicalApps.CompanyName" /> <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" />s are not suitable for use in the presence of flammable anesthetic mixture with air, or in the presence of a flammable anesthetic mixtures with oxygen or nitrous oxide.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><MadCap:variable name="ClinicalApps.CompanyName" /> <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" />s must be plugged into a grounded “Hospital Grade” electrical outlet to minimize the risk of electrical shock during the battery charging cycle.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the power plug of the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" /> is damaged, the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" /> can be operated using the onboard battery system. Report this condition  to Technical Service immediately for repair.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Some <MadCap:variable name="ClinicalApps.CompanyName" /> <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" />s contain a sealed, rechargeable, lead-acid, AGM type battery. <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" />s should always be plugged in to avoid deep discharge cycles that can shorten the battery’s useful life. Other than keeping the batteries charged by keeping the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" /> plugged in, no user maintenance of the batteries is required.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Provide adequate ventilation. The <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" /> may overheat if powered on or plugged in and charging while stored for extended periods in an area without adequate ventilation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The power cord may pose a trip hazard if not properly secured prior to moving the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" />.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Avoid manually adjusting the camera's position. Doing so will reset the camera's default "Home", or resting, position. This can only be restored to the original front-facing centered view through the Provider Access Software.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Leakage current from interconnected electrical equipment may exceed safe levels. In order to maintain patient and user safety, it is important to interconnect only with devices in compliance with IEC 60601-1-1requirements. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that any interconnected equipment not supplied by InTouch Health maintains compliance with IEC 60601-1-1 requirements.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>InTouch <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" />s are designed to utilize the 802.11 ac/a/b/g/n communication protocol as well as the public Internet in order to achieve their intended purpose. Failures in either of these supporting systems could cause a complete loss of communication between the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.CS" /> and the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" />. A tested backup method of communication should be available in the event network communication is lost.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The video images transmitted to and displayed on the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" /> and InTouch <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.CS" /> may not contain all of the information in the original scene. Video information from the camera is captured, compressed, transmitted, and redisplayed remotely at a different resolution. As a result, information in the original scene may be lost.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Color reproduction in the transmitted video is not guaranteed. Color reproduction in a video system is a complicated combination of lighting, cameras, and display technology. It should not be assumed that the colors on the display are an exact replication of the actual colors in the scene.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Avoid reliance upon video systems for diagnosis and video teleconferencing. Limitations including those outlined above mean video conferencing is not a perfect substitute for in-person interaction with a trained care provider.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Clinical judgment and experience are required to review and interpret images and information transmitted via the Patient Access Device and Provider Access Software.</p>
            </li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Devices.Vici">
                <p>An ESD event may cause the PTZ camera to stop outputting live video. If this should occur, unplug the Vici from the wall, and cycle the Vici power using the rocker switch.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Do not attempt to open or remove any parts of the <MadCap:variable name="ClinicalApps.CompanyName" /> <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" />. To reduce the risk of electric shock, do not remove the cover. There are no user-serviceable components inside. Refer servicing and repair to qualified personnel only.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" />s with locking wheels, the wheels may lock when the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" /> is in motion if lock is engaged accidentally.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" />s with locking wheels, the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" /> may tip forward if pushed with too much force when wheels lock. Please take care when moving to avoid damage or injury.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Safety Cautions</h2>
        <p><b class="Note">Cautions</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>InTouch Health does not support the addition of third party software to any <MadCap:variable name="ClinicalApps.CompanyName" /> <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" />. Adding third party software (especially for video conferencing) to the computer can cause the InTouch Vici to malfunction. Please be advised to check with Technical Service PRIOR to installing any third party software.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" /> should be plugged in whenever it is possible so it is fully charged and ready for a consult.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Vici tablet can be removed using a 4mm Hex Allen Wrench. It is recommended to leave the device locked in place.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>There are no user-serviceable components. Refer servicing and repair to qualified personnel only.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Avoid concentrated bleach as a cleaning agent for any <MadCap:variable name="ClinicalApps.CompanyName" /> <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" />.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>DO NOT IMMERSE the <MadCap:variable name="ClinicalApps.CompanyName" /> <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" />. DO NOT ALLOW any cleaning solution inside the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" />. Avoid excess solution which may enter the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" /> through its openings.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" /> should be kept free from moisture and extreme temperatures.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><MadCap:variable name="ClinicalApps.CompanyName" /> has not performed safety and efficacy testing for many peripheral USB devices being used with the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" />s. Customers must test and validate medical peripherals for their own use cases and environments.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Ensure external USB devices are disconnected prior to moving the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" />.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
