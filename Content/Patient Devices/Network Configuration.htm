        <h1>Network Configuration</h1>
        <p>The InTouch Telehealth System is comprised of a Remote Presence Patient Access Device and a minimum of one Provider Access Software Device. The Provider Access and Patient Access Devices are linked via the Internet over a secure connection. The Patient Access Device operates on either an 802.11 ac/a/b/g/n Wi-Fi network or via Ethernet.</p>
        <h2>Wireless Network Considerations</h2>
        <p>The InTouch <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" /> requires a wireless network distributed over the area where it is intended to roam. The InTouch <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" /> may be configured for 802.11 ac/a/b/g/n. The optimal configuration is determined during installation.</p>
        <p>To attain optimal performance there are several considerations which must be taken into account when designing the wireless network.</p>
        <h2>Configuring the InTouch <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" /> Wireless Connection</h2>
        <p>The InTouch <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" /> Control Core uses a Windows computing environment and a wireless network card. This card is an Intel Ultimate N WiFi Link 6300 (Intel Dual Band Wireless AC 7260 WiFi).</p>
        <p>The wireless link can be configured using the Microsoft Windows Wireless configuration tool.</p>
