        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Health.InTouch Operating System" /> is a mobile, Telehealth platform that enables an individual to “be in two places at once.” Telehealth is the ability to project yourself to a remote location (without leaving your current location) and to move, see, hear and talk as though you were actually there. A Telehealth System is comprised of the InTouch Provider Access Software and a Patient Access Device, linked via the Internet over a secure broadband connection. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>While using the Provider Access Software an individual can access a Patient Access Device to visit people in a remote location. A physician can communicate with patients, family members, and other staff. The Patient Access Device’s two-way audio and video communications allow a user to be remotely available at the location and time that they are needed. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The InTouch Health family of Patient Access Devices include the InTouch Vita, which uses various sensor technologies to provide map-based autonomous navigation capability to destinations within its allowed regions. The family also includes the cart based InTouch Lite and InTouch Vici, and the Operating Room (OR) based InTouch Vantage, as well as the portable InTouch Xpress, InTouch Viewpoint and InTouch TV which offers flexibility, enabling physicians to extend their reach into a broad array of situations and environments ranging from the emergency room, to the clinic, and more. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>To ensure proper operation, users should be thoroughly familiar with their Telehealth System. Study of this user guide is essential. In addition, completion of proper training by an InTouch Health Representative is required for safe operation. All questions should be referred to a local InTouch Health Representative or the InTouch Health Technical Service.</p>
