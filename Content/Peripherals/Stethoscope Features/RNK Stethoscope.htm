        <h1>RNK Stethoscope</h1>
        <h2> RNK Stethoscope Kit Components</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Stethoscope assembly (pre-mounted on <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" />)</li>
            <li> Stethoscope chest piece</li>
            <li>Headset</li>
            <li>RNK product documentation</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>RNK&#160;Stethoscope Operation</h2>
        <p>On the Lite side, the Stethoscope chest piece is applied to a patient by hospital staff following the physician’s directions (received through normal Lite audio).</p>
        <div class="Note"><b class="Note">CAUTION</b>: Do not pull on the cables. Do not pull the Lite using the cables. Cables may break, especially near the junction points with the Lite.</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Assure the Lite is within 8 feet of the patient exam site.</li>
            <li>Put on the Stethoscope headset (if desired).</li>
            <li>Put on gloves.</li>
            <li>Remove the Stethoscope chest piece and disinfect it with a disposable sanitary wipe.</li>
            <li>Expose the patient area and apply the chest piece as directed by the physician.</li>
            <li>Disinfect the chest piece and return it to the hanging bracket on the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" />.</li>
            <li>Remove gloves.</li>
            <li>Remove the headset and return it to the hanging bracket on the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" />.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Stethoscope Headset</h2>
        <p>The use of the headset is optional, and can be used to assist with placement of the chest piece on the patient or as an aid for teaching or mentoring. The <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" /> headset allows the medical assistant to listen to the Stethoscope while still being able to hear the normal <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" /> audio and other sounds in the environment.</p>
        <div class="Note"><b class="Note">NOTE</b>: The RNK Stethoscope unit, once plugged in, is always “on”.</div>
        <h2 style="page-break-before: always;">RNK&#160;Stethoscope Volume Control</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/RNK Stethoscope Volume Controls.png" class="floatright" />
        </p>
        <p>It is important to note that local volume controls exist on both Provider Access Software and the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" /> Stethoscope units. These volume control knobs affect ONLY the volume of the headset attached to them. Alteration of the volume control on the RNK Stethoscope unit will NOT change the volume on the Provider Access Software headset. This must be done at the Provider Access Software.</p>
        <div class="NoteWImage">
            <div class="Note">
                <p><b class="Note">Notes</b>: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>As with the volume control knob, separate Diaphragm &amp; Bell controls exist on both the Provider Access Software and <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" /> Stethoscope units which affect ONLY what is heard through the headset attached to them. Refer to the RNK documentation for more information on the operation of the Stethoscope unit.</li>
                    <li>The action of the RNK Stethoscope unit is referred to as the “TX Mode” in the RNK documentation.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
