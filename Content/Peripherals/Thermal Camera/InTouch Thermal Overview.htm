        <h1>InTouch Thermal Overview</h1>
        <h2>Intended Use</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Product Names.Thermal Camera" />™ camera is intended for adjunctive use in audio and video telemedicine consultations.</p>
        <h2>Indications for Use</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Product Names.Thermal Camera" /> is intended to view, measure and record heat patterns and variations. It is intended for use as adjunctive diagnostic imaging for thermally significant indications stemming from heat emitted from the human body. The significance of these thermal patterns and variations is determined by professional investigation. This device is intended for use by qualified technical personnel trained in its use. Clinical judgment and experience are required to review and interpret the information transmitted.</p>
        <h2>Intended Environment</h2>
        <p>  Environments anticipated are Hospitals, Ambulatory Care Clinics, Skilled Nursing Facilities, and other professional healthcare facilities.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The <MadCap:variable name="Product Names.Thermal Camera" />  camera must be connected to the InTouch device before starting a session.</li>
                <li>Do not hold the <MadCap:variable name="Product Names.Thermal Camera" /> camera in your hands while using, as the heat from your hand may affect the thermal images provided by the <MadCap:variable name="Product Names.Thermal Camera" /> device.</li>
                <li>Any thermal measurement provided by the <MadCap:variable name="Product Names.Thermal Camera" /> camera is not intended as an absolute measurement of temperature and is intended to be used in conjunction with other temperature measuring devices.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>The InTouch Thermal camera is not intended for use in Home Healthcare or Special Environments, as defined in IEC 60601-1-2:2014.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>The emissions characteristics of this equipment make it suitable for use in hospitals (CISPR 11 Class A). If it is used in a residential environment (for which CISPR 11 Class B is normally required) this equipment might not offer adequate protection to radio-frequency communication services. The user might need to take mitigation measures, such as relocating or reorienting the equipment.</li>
