            <ul>
                <li>The video images transmitted to and
displayed on the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" /> and Provider Access may
not contain all of the information in the original
scene. Video information from the camera is
captured, compressed, transmitted, and
redisplayed remotely at a different resolution. As
a result information in the original scene may be
lost.
</li>
                <li>Color reproduction in the transmitted
video is not guaranteed. Color reproduction in a
video system is a complicated combination of
lighting, cameras, and display technology. It
should not be assumed that the colors on the
display are an exact replication of the actual
colors in the scene.
</li>
                <li>Clinical judgment and experience are
required to review and interpret images and
information transmitted via the Lite and Provider
Access Software.

            <ul>
                <li>Adding third party software or
hardware to the Lite may cause it to malfunction
or operate erratically. Excluding those devices
designed for connection through existing
hardware ports, InTouch Health does not
support the addition of third party software or
hardware to the Lite. Please check with Technical
Service PRIOR to installing any other third party
devices.
</li>
                <li>Do not leave video equipment
connected to the Auxiliary Video Input. The
equipment or the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" /> may be damaged if
the <MadCap:variable name="InTouch Lite.Robots" /> is moved with equipment connected to
the Input.</li>
